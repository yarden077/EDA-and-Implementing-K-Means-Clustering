## EDA and Implementing K Means Clustering
This project provides a modular framework for data analysis and clustering using dataset containing information about bike rentals in London.
It is structured in three main components:

#### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing (data.py): 
This module manages data loading and preprocessing. It includes functions to load datasets and perform initial cleaning and transformations, preparing the data for clustering and analysis.
#### 2. Clustering Algorithms (clustering.py): 
This module implements the K-means clustering algorithm. It includes utility functions to configure, train, and evaluate the model on the prepared dataset, facilitating the exploration of clustering behaviors and outcomes.
#### 3. Main Application (main.py): 
The main module orchestrates the workflow by loading data, configuring clustering models, running the clustering algorithms, and presenting the results. 

#### Usage
Run the main script with the desired options to load data, perform clustering, and view results. This setup provides a scalable base for experimenting with clustering methods and analyzing data in various contexts.
