# EDA-and-Implementing-K-Means-Clustering
This project provides a modular framework for data analysis and clustering. It is structured in three main components:

# 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing (data.py): This module manages data loading and preprocessing. It includes functions to load datasets and perform initial cleaning and transformations, preparing the data for clustering and analysis.
# 2. Clustering Algorithms (clustering.py): This module implements various clustering methods, such as K-means. It also provides utility functions to configure, train, and evaluate clustering models on the prepared datasets, facilitating the exploration of clustering behaviors and outcomes.
# 3. Main Application (main.py): The main module orchestrates the workflow by loading data, configuring clustering models, running the clustering algorithms, and presenting the results. It also supports command-line arguments for flexible configuration, making it easy to customize clustering parameters and data sources.
# Usage
Run the main script with the desired options to load data, perform clustering, and view results. This setup provides a scalable base for experimenting with clustering methods and analyzing data in various contexts.
